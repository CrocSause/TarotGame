A Tarot Reading Game made with Java and the assistance of Claude. 

Project Roadmap: Tarot Card Game
Development Timeline Overview
Total Estimated Duration: 6-8 weeks (part-time development, ~8-12 hours/week)

Phase 1: Foundation Layer (Weeks 1-2.5)
Week 1: Core Data Models
Component: Card Model

Time Estimate: 3-4 days
Dependencies: None (foundational component)
Deliverables:

Card class with name, meanings, orientation
Major Arcana card definitions (22 cards)
Basic toString() and utility methods



Milestone 1 Checkpoint: Can create and display individual cards with meanings 
Component: Deck Management

Time Estimate: 3-4 days
Dependencies: Card Model (must be complete)
Deliverables:

Deck initialization with all Major Arcana
Shuffle functionality with proper randomization
Draw methods preventing duplicates



Milestone 2 Checkpoint: Can create, shuffle, and draw cards from deck

Week 2: Interpretation Foundation
Component: Interpretation Service (Basic Version)

Time Estimate: 5-6 days
Dependencies: Card Model
Deliverables:

Load card meanings from external file
Basic position-aware interpretations (Past/Present/Future context)
Simple meaning combination logic



Proof-of-Concept Stage: Create a simple console test that draws 3 cards and shows their meanings
Milestone 3 Checkpoint: Can generate basic interpretations for card combinations

Phase 2: Core Game Logic (Weeks 2.5-4)
Week 2.5-3: Reading System
Component: Reading System

Time Estimate: 4-5 days
Dependencies: Card Model, Interpretation Service
Deliverables:

Reading class storing Past/Present/Future cards
Timestamp and formatting functionality
Integration with interpretation generation



Component: Game Engine (Core)

Time Estimate: 3-4 days
Dependencies: Card Model, Deck Management, Reading System, Interpretation Service
Deliverables:

Coordinate complete reading workflow
Basic error handling and validation
Session state management



Milestone 4 Checkpoint: Can generate complete readings end-to-end (no UI yet)

Week 3.5-4: User Interface
Component: Console UI

Time Estimate: 5-6 days
Dependencies: Game Engine (critical path dependency)
Deliverables:

Interactive menu system
Formatted reading display
User input validation and error handling



Prototype Stage: Create minimal viable product with basic console interaction
Milestone 5 Checkpoint: Fully functional console-based tarot game

Phase 3: Enhancement Layer (Weeks 4.5-6)
Week 4.5-5.5: Historical Features
Component: Reading History

Time Estimate: 4-5 days
Dependencies: Reading System, potentially UI for display
Deliverables:

Reading storage and retrieval
History display functionality
Basic search/filter capabilities



Component: Enhanced Game Engine

Time Estimate: 2-3 days
Dependencies: Reading History
Deliverables:

Integration with history system
Improved error handling
Session management enhancements



Milestone 6 Checkpoint: Complete console application with full feature set

Week 5.5-6: Polish & Testing
Testing & Refinement

Time Estimate: 4-5 days
Dependencies: All components
Deliverables:

Comprehensive unit tests for all components
Integration testing
Bug fixes and performance optimization
Code documentation review



Milestone 7 Checkpoint: Production-ready console version

Phase 4: Future Preparation (Weeks 6-8)
Week 6-7: JavaFX Foundation
JavaFX Migration Planning

Time Estimate: 3-4 days
Deliverables:

UI mockups and design planning
JavaFX project structure setup
Asset preparation (card images, layouts)



Component: JavaFX UI (Basic)

Time Estimate: 7-10 days
Dependencies: Complete console version
Deliverables:

Basic JavaFX interface
Card display with images
Menu system migration




Critical Dependencies & Risk Management
Blocking Dependencies:

Card Model → Everything: All components depend on this foundation
Deck + Interpretation → Reading System: Cannot create readings without both
Reading System → Game Engine: Engine orchestrates reading creation
Game Engine → UI: Interface needs complete backend

Parallel Development Opportunities:

Interpretation Service can be developed alongside Deck Management
Reading History can be developed while polishing UI
Testing can begin as soon as each component is complete

Risk Mitigation:

Week 2: If Interpretation Service is complex, reduce initial scope to hard-coded meanings
Week 3: If Game Engine proves challenging, create simplified version focusing on happy path
Week 4: If Console UI is taking too long, create minimal interface first

Proof-of-Concept Recommendations
POC 1 (End of Week 1): "Card Showcase"

Simple main method that creates all 22 cards and displays them
Tests basic Card and Deck functionality

POC 2 (End of Week 2): "Magic 8-Ball Style"

Draw single card and show interpretation
Tests integration between major components

POC 3 (End of Week 3): "Complete Reading Demo"

Automated 3-card reading without user input
Validates entire backend workflow

POC 4 (End of Week 4): "MVP Release"

Fully interactive console version
Ready for user testing and feedback
